In this project, Iâ€™m using the DeepSat-6 satellite dataset which contains images extracted from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) dataset to build a multi-class classification algorithm using convolution neural networks to assign a label for each image among several labels. The original dataset was extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/deepsat-sat6).
